This thesis examines the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) \cite{vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023} to automate the administrative regularity control process in municipalities. By leveraging an LLM to analyze municipal documents and applying a structured checklist for compliance evaluation, this study compares automated outcomes with traditional human assessments. The methodology encompasses data preprocessing, prompt engineering  \cite{bsharatPrincipledInstructionsAre2024}, and a detailed comparative analysis of results obtained from both approaches. Findings indicate that while the LLM demonstrates significant potential in terms of efficiency and consistency, certain limitations and challenges remain when compared to expert human judgment. This research not only contributes to the evolving field of artificial intelligence in public administration but also offers practical insights for enhancing regulatory oversight through technological innovation.
